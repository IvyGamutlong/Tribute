            <h3>1945-1976<br /><small>Rodrigo Roa Duterte was born on March 28, 1945, in Maasin, Southern Leyte, Philippines. His father, Vicente, served as a local mayor and governor, and his mother, Soledad, was a teacher and a community activist. Prone to misbehavior, Duterte was twice expelled from elementary school. He managed to channel his temper somewhat by the time he attended Lyceum of the Philippines University, where he was influenced by Communist Party of the Philippines founder José María Sison. Duterte went on to study law at San Beda College, earning his degree in 1972 despite claims that he shot a classmate.</small></h3>

            <h3>1988<br /><small>That same year, President Ferdinand Marcos was ousted in the "People Power Revolution," fueling an increase in crime that was particularly rampant in Davao City. Elected mayor in 1988, Duterte sought to crack down on criminal activity by imposing a strict curfew and drinking laws. Additionally, he permitted the actions of a vigilante "death squad" — often referred to as the "Davao Death Squad" and “Duterte Death Squad” — that reportedly killed more than 1,000 suspected drug dealers and gang members over a 20-year span. <br>Nicknamed the "Punisher" for his controversial methods, Duterte nevertheless was successful in reducing crime. Furthermore, he was credited with helping to make Davao City cleaner by enforcing a smoking ban, and for his LGBT-friendly measures. His popularity was such that he served seven terms as mayor, sidestepping term limits with stints as a congressman and vice mayor, and drew huge ratings with a weekly television program.</small>                  </h3>

  <h3>2015-2016 Presidential Campaign<br><small>After initially dismissing the idea he would run for president, Duterte reversed course and threw his hat into the race in late 2015. Among other promises, he said he would establish a new federal parliamentary government and revive the country's steel industry. <br>However, the substance of his campaign was quickly overshadowed by a series of outrageous statements. He insisted he would massacre criminals and refused to apologize for a joke about the rape of an Australian missionary. His brashness invited comparisons to Donald Trump, who was simultaneously running his own unfiltered campaign for president in the United States.<br>The strategy proved effective, as Duterte nearly doubled the votes compiled by his two closest opponents. In May 2016, he was officially named the 16th president of the Philippines, and the first from its southern island of Mindanao.</small></h3>

  <h3>Philippines President<br><small>After taking office, Duterte signed an executive order to provide full disclosure of government records and transactions and announced plans to decongest airports. Vigilante attacks continued under his watch, and thousands of criminals reportedly surrendered to authorities. Viewed as a tough, effective leader, Duterte scored a 91 percent approval rating in late July. <br>However, despite being subjected to greater international scrutiny in his new role, Duterte refused to scale back his incendiary rhetoric. Among his headline-making comments, he lashed out at U.S. President Barack Obama over mention of the extrajudicial killings, and compared himself to Hitler for his desire to exterminate drug addicts. <br>Duterte also threatened to shake up longtime alliances with his words. Upon a state visit to China in October, he announced that he was "separating" with the U.S. and aligning himself with the "ideological flow" of his host country. Although he later softened those remarks, he left many wondering whether he would attempt to tip the balance of power in the Pacific region.</small></h3>
